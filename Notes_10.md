# Configuration Management with Ansible and Terraform â€“ 09 February 2025  
## Terraform State
- It is a file that tracks the state of infrastructure managed by Terraform.
- It contains the details of all resources along with status such as ACTIVE, DELETED and PROVISIONING

### Purpose of using the Terraform State
- Act as database to map configurations to real-world resources.
- Ensures that each resource in the configuration corresponds to a specific remote object.
- Tracking and management of infrastructure changes.
- Tracks dependencies between resources.
- Planning and application speeding by caching the attribute values of all resources.
- Reduces the need for querying all resources.

### Core components of Terraform State Files
- version - Version of the state file format
- terraform_version - Indicates the version of terraform
- serial - auto_increment with every state change
- outputs - stores output values defined in the Configuration
- lineage - Unique identifier for state file lineage
- resources - List of all managed resources
  - type - type of the resource
  - name - name of the resource
  - provider - identifies the provider used for managing the resource
### Instances in State File
- It provides the current state attributes and dependencies for each resource ensuring accurate state management.
- Each resource can have multiple instances
  - attributes
  - dependencies
## Terraform Backends
- It defines where and how Terraform stores state data.
- Configuring a backend to store the state file for user infrastructure is crucial
- Without a backend , the user will have to manually manage the state file.
- Two types of back end
  - Local Backend - stores state file on the local disk.suitable for individual project
  - Remote Backend - stores the state file in a remote , shared store.
 ## Managing Terraform state using default local backend 
```bash
$mkdir tf_state_local
$cd tf_state_local
$nano main.tf
```
```tf
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "your access_key"
  secret_key = "your secret_key"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
    bucket = "demo-bucket-terraform-state-avg"
}
```
```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform validate
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
## check s3 to check whether bucket has created or not
$ cat terraform.tfstate
$nano terraform.tf
```
```tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "demo-bucket-terraform-state-avg"
    key = "prod/aws_infra"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```
```bash
$ terraform init ## will throw an error because credentials are missing
$ terraform init -backend-config="access_key=''" -backend-config="secret_key=''"
## check s3 to check whether bucket has folder created prod/aws_infra or not
$ terraform validate
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
## check s3 to check whether bucket has tfstate file created under prod/aws_infra or not
$ cat terraform.tfstate ## it will be empty as state file moved to s3
$ terraform destroy -auto-approve # will throw error deleting S3 Bucket is not empty
```
